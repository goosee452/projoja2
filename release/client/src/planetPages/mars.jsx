        <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, nicknamed The Red Planet.

            Mars is a terrestrial planet with caps of water and carbon dioxide. It has the largest volcano in the Solar System, and some very large impact craters.[5]

            Mars is named after the mythological Roman god of war because it appears of red color. Anything that has to do with Mars is called "Martian".

            Space probes, such as the Viking program landers, are the main tools for the exploration of Mars.</p>
        <p>Mars is a terrestrial planet and made of rocks. The ground there is red because of iron oxide (rust) in the rocks and dust. The planet's atmosphere is very thin. It is mostly carbon dioxide with some argon and nitrogen and tiny amounts of other gases including oxygen. The temperatures on Mars are colder than on Earth, because it is farther away from the Sun and has less air to keep heat in. There is water ice and frozen carbon dioxide at the north and south poles.[6] Mars does not have any liquid water on the surface now, but signs of run-off on the surface were probably caused by water.

            The average thickness of the planet's crust is about 50 km (31 mi), with a maximum thickness of 125 km (78 mi).</p>
        <p>Mars does not have a global magnetic field.[10] Despite this, observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized. This suggests that polarity reversals have occurred in the past. This paleomagnetism is similar to the magnetic striping found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo stopped working and the planet's magnetic field faded.</p>
        <p>Geological evidence gathered by unmanned missions suggest that Mars once had much liquid water on its surface.[17] In 2005, radar data revealed the presence of large quantities of water ice at the poles,[18] and at mid-latitudes. The Mars rover Spirit sampled chemical compounds containing water molecules in March 2007. The Phoenix lander found water ice in shallow Martian soil in July 2008.[19] Landforms seen on Mars strongly suggest that liquid water at some time existed on the planet's surface. Huge areas of ground have been scraped and eroded.</p>
